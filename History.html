    <h1> History  </h1>
    The Great Depression in the 1930s led to the development of homeless settlements in the country’s major cities.It began to emerge in the late 1970s in NYC, when the presence of homeless men sleeping in the streets at night became more common. Many of them congregated around the Bowery and other “skid row” districts. The emergency shelters were usually inadequate in providing shelter for the homeless.
    In the 1980s, homelessness became a much more visible problem, with countless of people sleeping in the streets, on church steps and in public squares.
