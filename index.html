        Homelessness has always been a big problem within New York City. It wasn't until the late 1970s that the issue of homelessness became more widespread, 
        as homeless men began sleeping on the streets at night. Though, as of recent homelessness in New York City has reached the highest level since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Based on officials, the number of people sleeping in New York City's main shelter system in December 2021 was 48,691. Of those, 15,227 were children. The number of single adults sleeping in shelters was close to the record of 18,704 each night.The rate of homelessness has increased drastically within the past few years, but what are the government or our community doing to help them? People dont realize that they are humans just like us! Action needs to be taken to help these people get into safe centers so that they can get proper care.
