    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>In New York City there are many problems, one of these problems being the insane
        amount of homeless people that are on the streets of our city. Instead of investing
        money into helping them useless things are being bought and placed throughout our city.
        An example of this would be the 11.7 Million dollar gold cube thats sitting in the middle
        of central park gaurded.
