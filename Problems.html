    <h1>Problems</h1>
    New York obviouly has alot of problems that range from crime rates to rats, but one of the major problems is the amount of homeless people that lives on the streets nowadays. Why is this you may ask? its because to people really care about one another if its not themselves. What has the city done to help the people. Instead of investing in usefull programs that can help benefit these people New York are adding things that can not help the people of this city. An example of this is the recent cube that was just placed in the middle of central park that is worth $11.7M, being secured by security. It's almost like a tease for the unfortunate people out there.
